# nasa_pic_of_the_day

More playing around because, again, in lock down. I just found out though that my area is slowly opening up, but none of the restaurants around me are doing dine in. So I guess it's door dash. In the background I'm streaming Stargate Atlantis but not really watching it. THough it did give me the inspiration to see whether or not NASA has some APIs I can play with, and HAZZAH, they do. So it's just after 10 pm here and I've decided to write this quick script to give an example of how to make a rest call to the NASA API, perform a WGET within PYTHON, and address an SSL CERTIFICATE issue. 

Enjoy, hope this provides some good examples.
